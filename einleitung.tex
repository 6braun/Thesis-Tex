\lipsum[2] Meanwhile, information technology~(IT)\nomenclature{IT}{Information technology} has become essential to exchange information between involved inter-organizational actors and across global supply chains more efficiently. Big data can be defined as ``data whose size forces us to look beyond the tried-and-true methods that are prevalent at that time.'' \citep[][p.~44]{jacobs_pathologies_2009}


Although a consistent definition of big data has yet to be specified, there is a common understanding that big data is data whose size and complexity forces us to look beyond conventional tools and methods to exploit and utilize it \citep[cf.][p.~44]{jacobs_pathologies_2009}.

According to \citet[][p.~44]{jacobs_pathologies_2009},  big data can be seen as data whose size $e + p = y$ and complexity forces us to look beyond conventional tool and methods to exploit and utilize it.
